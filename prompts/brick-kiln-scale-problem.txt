2,800,000 km² → Minutes
Real-time monitoring
Reproducible
Change detection enabled

✓ Scalable solution for unorganized sector

Center Visual Elements:
India map outline
Scale indicators
Time comparison arrows

Footer:
IIT Gandhinagar

⚠️ CRITICAL: Perfect spelling. Clean visual hierarchy.

- Simple satellite imagery representation
- Grid pattern to show coverage area

Time Indicators:
- Clock icons prominent
- Hours clearly labeled
- Visual size difference (12h small, 7000h large)

Scale Comparison:
- Clear visual hierarchy showing 10,000 → 2,800,000
- Numerical emphasis
- Area proportions represented

Workflow Icons:
- Manual annotation: person + magnifying glass/pointer
