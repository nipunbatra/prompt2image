Visual Composition

Main Visual Element:
Full-width Sentinel-2 satellite tile showing Indo-Gangetic Plain region
High-resolution true-color or false-color composite
Shows agricultural landscape with visible kiln structures

Technical Overlay:
3 Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) overlaid on the satellite image
Each OBB highlights a different brick kiln type:
- One circular kiln (CFCBK - Circular Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kiln) with visible tall chimney
- One rectangular kiln (FCBK - Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kiln) with visible tall chimney
- One zigzag kiln (ZKBTK - Zigzag Kiln) - IMPORTANT: rectangular structure with internal zigzag firing pattern, with visible tall chimney

CRITICAL: All three kilns MUST have tall chimneys visible in the satellite image

OBB boxes should be:
- Rotated to match kiln orientation
- Thin, precise lines
- Bright color (cyan, lime green, or coral) for visibility
- Clean geometric rectangles at appropriate angles
- No labels on boxes
- No confidence scores
- No class names visible

Layout Structure:

Top Section (30%):
- Optional SUSTAINABILITY LAB logo (top-left, small)
- Title centered, spanning most of width
- Two-line title with clear hierarchy
- Clean sans-serif typography

Middle Section (60%):
- Full-width Sentinel-2 satellite tile
- Earth observation aesthetic
- Agricultural patchwork visible
- Brick kilns visible as distinct structures
- 3 OBB boxes clearly marking different kiln types
- Clean, uncluttered overlay

Bottom Section (10%):
- Presenter name and institution (bottom-right)
- Small, professional font
- White or light color for visibility

Design Language

Professional academic presentation aesthetic
Remote sensing / Earth observation style
Inspired by: Nature Geoscience covers, Science journal imagery, ESA/NASA presentations
Clean, editorial, high-impact visual
Typography: Sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica, Arial)

Color Palette

Satellite imagery: Natural Earth tones
- Agricultural fields: greens, browns, yellows
- Built structures: grays, whites
- Water bodies (if present): blues
- Natural true-color or near-infrared composite

OBB overlay boxes:
- Bright, high-contrast color (recommend: cyan #00ffff or lime #00ff00)
- Thin stroke (2-3 pixels)
- Semi-transparent fill (optional, very subtle)
- Should stand out clearly against earth tones

Text:
- Title: Dark gray or black (#1f2937) if on light background
- Or white if overlaid on darker satellite region
- Presenter info: White or light color
- High contrast for readability

Background:
- Satellite image fills frame
- Optional subtle vignette at edges
- No solid color backgrounds

Visual Specifications

Satellite Tile:
- Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery aesthetic
- 10m resolution appearance
- Shows ~5-10 km² area
- Agricultural landscape of Indo-Gangetic Plain
- Visible field patterns, roads, settlements
- Clean, high-quality satellite rendering

Brick Kiln Structures:
- Clearly visible in satellite image with TALL CHIMNEYS
- Distinct geometric shapes:
  - Circular kilns: round outline + prominent tall chimney in center or side
  - Rectangular kilns: elongated rectangular footprint + prominent tall chimney
  - Zigzag kilns: RECTANGULAR footprint (not zigzag shape!) with internal zigzag firing chambers + prominent tall chimney
- ALL kilns MUST show tall, vertical chimney stacks (key identifying feature)
- Chimneys appear as thin dark/light vertical structures casting shadows
- Should be actual visible structures from satellite view, not just boxes

Oriented Bounding Boxes:
- Precise geometric rectangles
- Rotated to match kiln orientation
- Each box tightly fits the kiln structure
- Different orientations for each (0°, 45°, 90° variations)
- Clean, technical detection aesthetic
- Computer vision overlay style

Typography:

Title:
- Large, bold sans-serif
- Two lines:
  Line 1: "AI From Space to Policy" (slightly larger or different weight)
  Line 2: "Scientific Advances in Brick-Kiln Detection and Compliance"
- Centered alignment
- Professional, academic weight

Presenter Info:
- Smaller font size
- Two lines:
  Line 1: "Nipun Batra"
  Line 2: "IIT Gandhinagar"
- Right-aligned or centered in bottom-right area

Logo:
- SUSTAINABILITY LAB with exact design:
  - L-shaped axes (vertical and horizontal lines meeting at corner)
  - Smooth sigmoid S-curve overlaid on axes
  - "SUSTAINABILITY" text (larger, medium weight, dark)
  - "LAB" text (smaller, light weight, letter-spaced, gray)
