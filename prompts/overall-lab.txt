Footer (bottom center, small): IIT Gandhinagar Visual Composition Create a unified visual narrative flowing 
left-to-right with five interconnected research pillars. The composition should suggest a complete research ecosystem 
from observation to action. Use subtle visual connectors (flowing data streams, light gradient transitions) to unify 
the pillars into a cohesive whole. 1. Observe (Far Left) Visual Elements: - Orbital view showing India and South Asia 
from space - Satellite tile grid overlay with detection bounding boxes - Three distinct brick kiln structures visible: 
circular (CFCBK), rectangular (FCBK), and zigzag patterns - Minimal geometric icons representing industrial emissions 
sources - Subtle atmospheric haze layer over the Indo-Gangetic Plain - Earth observation tiles in a grid pattern 
Technical Details: - Show oriented bounding boxes (OBB) around detected structures - Include grid cell decomposition 
suggesting systematic coverage - Represent 2.8 million square kilometer scale subtly through expansive view - 
Color-code different kiln types with subtle variations 2. Model (Center-Left) Visual Elements: - Neural network 
architecture emerging from satellite data - Gaussian process surfaces showing spatial interpolation - Uncertainty bands 
around predictions (epistemic uncertainty visualization) - Heatmap gradients showing PM2.5 concentration fields - 
Temporal sequences suggesting forecasting capability - Physics-informed connections (diffusion and advection flow 
patterns) Technical Details: - Show data flow from sparse sensor points to dense prediction surfaces - Visualize 
attention-like mechanisms and data streams - Represent surrogate model concept: complex physics simplified to AI - 
Include subtle node-edge structures for graph neural networks - No equations, no mathematical notation visible 3. Sense 
(Center) Visual Elements: - Abstract India map with sparse existing sensor locations (dots) - AI-suggested new sensor 
placements (distinct markers) - Mobile sensing concept: abstracted bus/vehicle paths through city grid - Coverage 
improvement visualization (expanding circles or Voronoi cells) - Equity-focused distribution pattern (sensors in 
underserved areas highlighted) - Spatial interpolation toolkit concept (Kriging, IDW patterns) Technical Details: - 
Show before/after sensor density contrast - Visualize optimal placement algorithm output - Include mobile sensing 
trajectories (Delhi bus routes abstraction) - Represent polire toolkit concept through interpolation patterns - No 
legends, no numerical counts, no axis labels 4. Decide (Center-Right) Visual Elements: - Natural language interface 
representation (chat-like UI panels) - Code generation flow (query to Python to visualization) - Multiple stakeholder 
silhouettes: policymaker at desk, researcher with laptop, citizen with phone - Dashboard screens showing maps, 
time-series plots, bar charts - Conversational interaction implied through speech-bubble-like shapes (no text inside) - 
Data democratization concept: complex data simplified for diverse users Technical Details: - Show VayuBuddy/VayuChat 
system concept - Visualize LLM-powered code generation pipeline abstractly - Include CPCB data flow representation - 
Show multiple output types: textual answers, visualizations, map plots - Clean UI aesthetic, no cluttered dashboards 5. 
Sustain (Far Right) Visual Elements: - Smart home/building outline with energy flow visualization - Disaggregated 
appliance signatures (waveform patterns) - Thermal camera view of human face showing respiration detection (nostril 
heat patterns) - Health monitoring concept: mask with embedded sensors (SpiroMask) - Wearable device showing 
calorie/energy expenditure - Energy meter connecting to individual appliance icons Technical Details: - Show NILMTK 
energy disaggregation concept - Visualize JoulesEye thermal imaging for respiration - Include fitness/exercise context 
(cycling, running silhouettes) - Represent non-intrusive load monitoring principle - Show health sensing as extension 
of sustainability mission Visual Connectors Between Pillars - Flowing data streams connecting adjacent sections - 
Gradient color transitions suggesting continuous pipeline - Subtle particle flow patterns representing air quality data 
movement - Light connecting lines suggesting feedback loops (sensing informs modeling, modeling guides sensing) Design 
Language Style: Flat design with soft-depth hybrid, subtle shadows for hierarchy Mood: Calm, confident, research-grade, 
policy-ready Aesthetic Inspiration: IPCC assessment figures, Nature portfolio journal covers, OECD AI policy reports, 
World Bank data visualization standards Tone: Editorial, academic, authoritative but accessible Avoid: Marketing 
flashiness, startup aesthetics, infographic clich s Color Palette Background: Off-white to very light warm gray 
gradient (left to right) Primary: Deep blue (#1a365d) for structural elements and text Secondary: Muted teal (#2c7a7b) 
for AI/technology elements Accent 1: Restrained amber/ochre (#c77a00) for pollution/emission fields Accent 2: Soft sage 
green (#68d391) for health and sustainability elements Highlight: Coral (#f56565) for key detection points and alerts 
(use sparingly) Avoid: Neon colors, harsh saturated reds, pure black backgrounds, dark mode aesthetics Typography 
Guidance - Title: Sans-serif, bold, substantial weight - Section labels: Sans-serif, medium weight, smaller than title

Composition Balance - Equal visual weight across all five pillars - Central pillar (Sense) can be slightly elevated as 
connecting element - Adequate whitespace between sections for visual breathing room - Unified horizon line or baseline 
across the composition - Visual hierarchy: Title > Pillar Labels > Visual Elements > Footer Quality Specifications - 
Render at maximum available resolution - Ensure all edges are crisp and vector-like - No compression artifacts - 
Print-ready quality for large format poster (A0 or larger)
- Color accuracy for professional printing
