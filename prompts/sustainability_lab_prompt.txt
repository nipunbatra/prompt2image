Visual Composition

A single continuous left-to-right visual pipeline, flowing smoothly across the slide.

Section 1 — Emissions (Left)

Satellite-view abstraction of India / Indo-Gangetic Plain

Brick kilns, transport corridors, industries as clean geometric icons

Earth-observation tiles and bounding boxes (ML detection cue)

Soft translucent emission plumes

Label below section: Emissions

Section 2 — Modeling (Center-Left)

Emissions morphing into neural network structures

Graphs, attention-like flows, smooth interpolation

Heatmap fields representing pollution prediction

Visual metaphor: physics → AI surrogate

Label: Modeling

Section 3 — Sensing (Center-Right)

India map abstraction with sparse dots (existing sensors)

New dots appearing optimally across under-served regions

Subtle equity signal through balanced spatial coverage

No legends or numbers

Label: Sensing

Section 4 — Decision (Right)

Minimal silhouettes: policymaker, researcher, citizen

Simple UI panels: map, line plot, conversational interface shapes

Natural-language interaction implied visually (no speech text)

Label: Decision

Design Language

Flat + soft-depth hybrid

Editorial, policy-ready, not flashy

Inspired by IPCC figures, Nature Energy covers, OECD AI reports
