Visual Composition

A clean, modern web interface layout showing the VayuChat conversational AI system in action. The layout should feel like a polished web application screenshot.

Left Panel — Model & Query Selection (≈25% width)
Clean white sidebar with subtle rounded border
Dropdown menu showing "gpt-oss-120b" model selection
"Quick Queries" section below with expandable question list
Predefined query buttons in a vertical stack
Minimal icons (question mark, chevron indicators)
Soft shadows for depth

Center-Right Panel — Chat & Code Interface (≈75% width)
Top: Clean header with "VayuChat" branding and lab affiliation
Chat message bubble showing user query in blue accent color
Response bubble below in light gray/white showing answer with timestamp
Code panel below the chat with syntax-highlighted Python code
Visible imports and matplotlib styling setup
Clean monospace font for code
Bottom: Input field with placeholder text and send button (blue)

Visual Flow Indicators
Curved arrows or flow lines connecting:
1. Model selector → Query selection
2. Quick queries → Chat interface
3. Chat response → Generated code panel
4. Code panel → Custom input field

These should be subtle, editorial-style arrows (not cartoon-like)
Use coral/red accent color (#f56565) for emphasis

Design Language

Modern web UI aesthetic
Soft rounded corners (8-12px border radius)
Clean sans-serif typography (Inter, System UI family)

Hard Negative Constraints

❌ No extra text beyond specified interface labels
❌ No cartoon or playful illustration style
❌ No actual running code output or visualizations (only code text)
❌ No photorealistic screenshots with browser chrome/window decorations
❌ No cluttered dashboards or busy data visualizations
❌ No dark mode (use light theme)
❌ No neon or fluorescent accent colors
❌ No handwritten or script fonts
❌ No 3D rendered elements
❌ No stock photo elements or generic icons
❌ No visible URLs or navigation breadcrumbs
❌ No actual data visualizations (charts, graphs) - focus on interface only

Layout Specifications

Left sidebar: 20-25% of width
Main chat/code area: 75-80% of width
Adequate whitespace and padding throughout
Clear visual hierarchy: header > chat > code > input
Annotations/arrows should not overwhelm the interface
Interface should feel production-ready, not wireframe

Quality Requirements

Render at maximum available resolution
Crisp text rendering (all labels must be readable)
No compression artifacts
Print-ready quality for academic poster
Consistent spacing and alignment
Professional UI/UX design standards

Functional Context

VayuChat is an LLM-powered conversational interface for air quality data analysis
Users can ask natural language questions about pollution trends, city comparisons, temporal patterns
System generates executable Python code using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Responses include both natural language answers and the underlying code
Designed for researchers, policymakers, and citizens to democratize access to air quality insights
Built on top of CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) India dataset
