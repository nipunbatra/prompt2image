Visual Composition

Create a single continuous left-to-right pipeline illustration spanning the entire slide.

1. Emissions (Left)

Satellite-style view of India / Indo-Gangetic Plain

Brick kilns, transport corridors, industries as minimal geometric icons

Earth-observation tiles, grid overlays, bounding boxes

Soft translucent pollution plumes (scientific, non-dramatic)

2. Modeling (Center-Left)

Emissions flowing into neural network structures

Attention-like connections and smooth data streams

Pollution heatmaps emerging from AI models

Visual metaphor: physics-based complexity → AI surrogate simplicity

No equations, no numbers, no extra labels

3. Sensing (Center-Right)

India map abstraction

Sparse existing sensor dots plus new AI-suggested locations

Clear visual signal of improved spatial coverage and fairness

No legends, no counts

4. Decision (Right)

Minimal silhouettes: policymaker, researcher, citizen

Clean UI panels with maps, line plots, and conversational interface shapes

Natural-language interaction implied visually (no text bubbles)

Design Language

Flat + soft-depth hybrid

Calm, confident, policy-ready

Inspired by IPCC figures, Nature Energy covers, OECD AI reports

Editorial, not flashy

Color Palette

Background: off-white or very light gray

Primary colors: deep blue, muted teal

Accents: restrained amber for pollution fields

Avoid neon, harsh reds, dark mode
